## dkube-examples

This repository contains the DL examples ported to run on Dkube and showcase the features of Dkube platform.

Features such as -

- Deep learning training on known frameworks like Tensorflow, Pytorch...
- Custom container based training which could be using custom frameworks or simple python/C++ code
- GPU based training.
- Distributed training.
- Hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal parameter space.
- Data preprocessing using custom containers.
- Automated workflow using Pipelines.

Following examples are provided,

## Tensorflow Examples

- Gray scale digits classification using MNIST network.
