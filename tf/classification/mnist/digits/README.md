# MNIST network classifier
This example is derived from [tensorflow example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/r1.4.0/official/mnist) and modified to run on Dkube Platform.

 - This program trains MNIST network on Gray scale Digits data.
 - Modified program is configurable and takes Hyperparameters like steps, batchsize, learning rate etc from ENV vars or from a JSON file. User can input these parameters from Dkube UI or upload a file which will then be provided for the running instance of program.
 - Program is modified to be able to run in distributed training mode. User can select this mode while training in Dkube.
 - Program is modified to write TF summaries and use custom Dkube session hook to emit out some critical information about the training which is then displayed on Dkube UI Dashboard.
### Tensorflow 2 Example (without compat mode) and Tensorflow 2.3 Advanced Example is added in classifier/program-tf2.
- Follow the README https://github.com/oneconvergence/dkube-examples-internal/blob/master/tf/classification/mnist/digits/classifier/program-tf2/README.md

# Directories

 - **classifier/program** : This directory has training code files implemented on top of Tensorflow framework.
 - **classifier/data**: This directory has processed training data. Program trains on this data.
 - **inference**: This directory has compatible test data images which can be used for inference.
 - **hptuning/tuning.yaml**: Sample YAML showing the configuration format and parameters for tuning.
 - **pipeline/dkube-mnist-pipeline.ipynb**: Ipython notebook with the code. Upload the file in Dkube notebook and run all the cells. This notebook will generate and trigger the run of pipeline.

# Hyperparameter tuning
1. Hyperparameter tuning is useful to find the appropriate parameter space for DL training. Dkube will auto generate all the possible combinations of parameters specified and runs training for each of the combination till the goal specified or max count is reached.
2. Dkube plots the graphs for comparision and suggests a best run with hyperparameters used for the run.
3. Create a job same as explained in section  *[\[How to Train\]](#How%20to%20Train)* except that now a tuning file also needs to be uploaded in the *Parameters Tuning* section of the *Training Job*  form.
4. For this example, sample tuning file is present in the *github* as explained in section [Directories](#%20Directories). Alternately, showing the content below - copy-paste and create a new file for upload.
```
parallelTrialCount: 3
maxTrialCount: 6
maxFailedTrialCount: 3
objective:
  type: maximize
  goal: 0.99
