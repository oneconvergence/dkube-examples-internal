# RESNETv2 network classifier
**<TODO - Add some links or brief about this network>**

Following samples are provided for this network.
- **catsdogs**

    This example is derived from [retraining](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_retraining) and modified to run on Dkube Platform.

    The example retrains a [resnetv2](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/resnet_v2_50/feature_vector/1) model for binary classification with catsdogs data.

    Program is avaliable @ **catsdogs/classifier/program**.

    Program trains on *catsdogs* dataset which available @ **catsdogs/classifier/data**.
